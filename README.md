# Notes 
- @react-three/drei for easily giving orbit contols

- applying texture on the model directly makes it harder to load so a **normal map** is used to reduce processing and make the rendering smoother

- opngl by default loads on low quality colourspace and tectures the we have to manually upgrade the colourspace
